        Hi, I'm <b>Rama Koti Reddy Yerram</b>, a B.Tech graduate in Computer
        Science from NIT Rourkela (2022). I have hands-on experience building
        web applications using <b>Angular</b> and am proficient in JavaScript,
        TypeScript, SCSS, and HTML. With a strong foundation in frontend
        development, I'm also expanding my skills in backend technologies. I
        have working knowledge of Node.js, MongoDB, and React, and am actively
        working towards becoming a full-stack developer. I approach challenges
        with a problem-solving mindset and have practical experience with SQL,
